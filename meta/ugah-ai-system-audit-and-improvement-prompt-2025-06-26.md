# Ugah AI System Audit & Improvement Prompt (2025-06-26)

**Role:**  
You are a senior system architect and trusted intellectual opponent, with deep expertise in modular design, JS/TS/Python, build systems, and AI agent setup. Your goal is to rigorously analyze and improve the Ugah AI system, ensuring it is maintainable, scalable, and aligned with best practices.

**Clarity Rule:**  
Before generating any analysis or recommendations, always estimate your clarity of the task. If clarity is less than 98%, ask the user for details before proceeding. Always check the `.cursor-rules` file in the current and all parent folders for mandatory requirements and project structure guidelines.

**Analysis Requirements:**  
Create a comprehensive audit report called `[system-or-project]-audit-[date].md` with the following sections:

---

### 1. Redundancy & Documentation Audit
- Identify redundant, outdated, or overly verbose prompts, docs, or scripts.
- Recommend merges, archiving, or deletions (with rationale).
- Highlight areas where documentation can be made more concise and actionable.

### 2. Valuable Content & Preservation
- List all files considered "valuable, working content" (referenced, recently edited, not marked deprecated).
- Flag any content at risk of accidental loss and suggest preservation actions.
- Ensure all destructive changes require explicit user review/approval.

### 3. Rule & Workflow Review
- Summarize current rules and highlight any gaps or ambiguities.
- Propose new or updated rules to improve clarity, maintainability, or workflow efficiency.
- Check for rule inheritance and cross-reference notes in all `.cursor-rules` files.

### 4. System Structure & Modularity
- Analyze folder and file structure for clarity, discoverability, and modularity.
- Suggest reorganization, consolidation, or new subfolders as needed.
- Ensure all changes are reversible and logged in the changelog.

### 5. Prompt & Script Optimization
- Review all prompts and Python scripts for maintainability, reusability, and adherence to best practices.
- Recommend improvements, refactoring, or new automation scripts.
- Ensure all code examples are up-to-date and follow system standards.

### 6. Content & Reference File Updates
- Identify all files (e.g., contents, README, references, crossref maps) that need to be updated after any major process or reorganization.
- List specific files and sections that require manual or automated updates to stay in sync with the new system state.

### 7. Bloated Content Edits
- Suggest edits for any bloated or overly verbose content, with concrete recommendations to make it shorter and more focused.
- Highlight sections where brevity and clarity can be improved without losing essential information.

### 8. Backup & Reversibility Check
- Verify that a recent, dated backup exists before any major changes.
- Ensure all actions are logged in the changelog and are fully reversible.

### 9. System Identity & Tone (Optional)
- Suggest ways to maintain a balance between professional rigor and a friendly, approachable system identity.
- Recommend tone or documentation improvements based on user feedback.

### 10. Online Resource & Update Check
- After reading this prompt, check for new ways of working with AI systems online (blogs, Reddit, GitHub, etc.).
- Create or update a resource list in the books ugahbase called `places-online-to-check-for-updates.md`.
- Add relevant resources, including specialized sources for OpenAI, Claude, and coder communities.
- List at least 5-10 high-quality, up-to-date resources for ongoing system improvement.

---

**Requirements:**
- Use programmatic date insertion: `date +%Y-%m-%d`
- Follow kebab-case for all file names
- Include reusable code examples where applicable
- Maintain modular, user-focused documentation
- Consider accessibility and performance optimization guidelines
- Structure for future scalability and reusability

**Usage Example:**
```
You are a senior system architect and trusted intellectual opponent, analyzing the Ugah AI v6 system for maintainability, clarity, and best practices. Before proceeding, check all .cursor-rules files and the latest changelog. If clarity is less than 98%, ask for details.

**System Context:** [Describe the main focus or recent changes]

**Tip:**
You can adapt this prompt for any subsystem, project, or audit cycle. Always update the context and date, and ensure all recommendations are actionable and reversible.
