## Red Flags (Delete These)
□ Files you haven't opened in 30+ days  
□ Scripts longer than their manual equivalent  
□ Documentation that explains obvious things  
□ Multiple files doing the same job  
□ "Future-proofing" for scenarios that never happened  
□ Templates with unused fields  
□ Rules that contradict each other  

## Keep These
□ Files you reference regularly  
□ Working automation that saves real time  
□ Your unique methods and voice  
□ Simple checklists that prevent errors  

## Quick Actions
- **Archive** (not delete): Move to `archive/` with date
- **Merge**: Combine similar files, reference the merger in changelog
- **Simplify**: Replace complex process with checklist when possible
