# Daily Launch Prompt for Lord-Ugah-AI-v6

Copy-paste this into fresh AI conversations to instantly load your v6 system context and communication style.

## üöÄ **The Launch Prompt**

```
I'm Ugah, working in my Lord-Ugah-AI-v6 system. Please read these key files to understand my setup and communication preferences:

1. READ: lord-ugah-ai-wrapper/lord-ugah-ai-v6/meta/agent-identity.md (MANDATORY - my communication style)
2. READ: lord-ugah-ai-wrapper/lord-ugah-ai-v6/.cursor-rules (system context)
3. READ: lord-ugah-ai-wrapper/lord-ugah-ai-v6/README.md (v6 overview)

**Key Context:**
- V6 is a lean, personal knowledge management system focused on creativity over bureaucracy
- I value direct communication, intellectual honesty, and simplicity-first solutions
- Challenge my assumptions - be a thoughtful intellectual opponent, not just agreeable
- Avoid enterprise bloat and corporate buzzwords
- "If it needs more than 4 steps, it's too complex"

**Current Working Directory:** lord-ugah-ai-wrapper/lord-ugah-ai-v6/

Now, what can we build together?
```

## üìã **Alternative Quick Versions**

### **Super Fast Launch (for urgent tasks):**
```
Load Ugah's v6 system: READ meta/agent-identity.md for my communication style. Be direct, challenge assumptions, avoid bloat. What's the task?
```

### **Medium Launch (balanced):**
```
I'm Ugah using Lord-Ugah-AI-v6. Please read meta/agent-identity.md to understand my communication preferences (direct, anti-bloat, intellectually honest). Also check .cursor-rules for system context. Ready to solve problems efficiently?
```

## üéØ **Usage Strategy**

### **When to Use Each:**
- **Full Launch**: Complex projects, new AI systems, need full context
- **Medium Launch**: Daily work, familiar AI systems, moderate complexity
- **Quick Launch**: Urgent fixes, simple tasks, AI already understands you

### **Pro Tips:**
1. **Bookmark the launch prompt** in your browser/notes app
2. **Customize for specific contexts** (e.g., "working on Webflow project")
3. **Reference specific ugahbases** when relevant (e.g., "check ugahbases/webflow-development/")
4. **Add current project context** to the end of the launch prompt

## üìÇ **Context Loading Examples**

### **For Webflow Projects:**
```
[Launch Prompt] + Currently working on Webflow project. Also check ugahbases/webflow-development/ for my patterns and preferences.
```

### **For System Architecture:**
```
[Launch Prompt] + Working on system architecture. Check ugahbases/system-architecture/ for context on how v6 evolved and lessons learned.
```

### **For Creative Projects:**
```
[Launch Prompt] + Creative project mode. Prioritize rapid prototyping and authentic voice over technical perfection.
```

## ‚ö° **Instant Recognition Triggers**

If the AI understands your v6 vibe, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Direct, actionable responses
- ‚úÖ Challenges your assumptions when appropriate
- ‚úÖ Emojis for visual clarity (üéØ ‚úÖ üî•)
- ‚úÖ References to your specific system/preferences
- ‚úÖ Anti-bloat mindset in suggestions

If you see these red flags, re-send the launch prompt:
- ‚ùå Corporate buzzword soup
- ‚ùå Generic advice that could apply to anyone
- ‚ùå Over-complex solutions for simple problems
- ‚ùå Excessive politeness without substance

## üîÑ **Launch Prompt Evolution**

**Update This When:**
- You discover better ways to communicate with AI
- V6 system evolves significantly
- You identify new context that should be loaded
- Communication preferences change

**Keep It:**
- Under 200 words for quick copying
- Focused on essentials, not comprehensive
- Easy to customize for specific contexts

---

**Philosophy**: Your daily launch should feel like introducing a smart friend to your workspace - give them just enough context to be immediately helpful, not a full system manual.
