# Daily Launch Prompt for Lord-Ugah-AI-v6

Copy-paste this into fresh AI conversations to instantly load your v6 system context and communication style.

## üöÄ **The Launch Prompt**

```
I'm Ugah, working in my Lord-Ugah-AI-v6 system. Read these files:

1. .cursor-rules (workspace root - mandatory rules)
2. lord-ugah-ai-wrapper/lord-ugah-ai-v6/meta/agent-identity.md (communication style)
3. lord-ugah-ai-wrapper/lord-ugah-ai-v6/.cursor-rules (v6 system context)
4. lord-ugah-ai-wrapper/lord-ugah-ai-v6/README.md (v6 overview)

Challenge my assumptions, be direct, avoid bloat. Current directory: lord-ugah-ai-wrapper/lord-ugah-ai-v6/

What's the task?
```

## üìã **Alternative Quick Versions**

### **Quick Launch:**
```
Load Ugah's v6: READ .cursor-rules (root) + meta/agent-identity.md. Be direct, challenge assumptions. Task?
```

## üéØ **Usage Strategy**

### **When to Use Each:**
- **Full Launch**: Complex projects, new AI systems, need full context
- **Medium Launch**: Daily work, familiar AI systems, moderate complexity
- **Quick Launch**: Urgent fixes, simple tasks, AI already understands you

### **Pro Tips:**
1. **Bookmark the launch prompt** in your browser/notes app
2. **Customize for specific contexts** (e.g., "working on Webflow project")
3. **Reference specific ugahbases** when relevant (e.g., "check ugahbases/webflow-development/")
4. **Add current project context** to the end of the launch prompt

## üìÇ **Context Loading Examples**

### **For Webflow Projects:**
```
[Launch Prompt] + Currently working on Webflow project. Also check ugahbases/webflow-development/ for my patterns and preferences.
```

### **For System Architecture:**
```
[Launch Prompt] + Working on system architecture. Check ugahbases/system-architecture/ for context on how v6 evolved and lessons learned.
```

### **For Creative Projects:**
```
[Launch Prompt] + Creative project mode. Prioritize rapid prototyping and authentic voice over technical perfection.
```

## ‚ö° **Instant Recognition Triggers**

If the AI understands your v6 vibe, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Direct, actionable responses
- ‚úÖ Challenges your assumptions when appropriate

- ‚úÖ References to your specific system/preferences
- ‚úÖ Anti-bloat mindset in suggestions

If you see these red flags, re-send the launch prompt:
- ‚ùå Corporate buzzword soup
- ‚ùå Generic advice that could apply to anyone
- ‚ùå Over-complex solutions for simple problems
- ‚ùå Excessive politeness without substance
