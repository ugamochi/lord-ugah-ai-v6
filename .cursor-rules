# Lord-Ugah-AI-v6 System Rules

> Note: This file supplements the root .cursor-rules in the workspace. For full system rules and standards, see the root .cursor-rules in the workspace root directory.

# Date Insertion Rule
> Inherited from root .cursor-rules - see workspace root for full date insertion requirements

# Personal knowledge management system - maintain authenticity and avoid corporate buzzwords

## Agent Communication Style (MANDATORY)
- Before responding to any request, read meta/agent-identity.md to understand Ugah's preferred communication style and tone
- Match the intellectual honesty, directness, and anti-bloat approach described in that file
- Challenge assumptions when appropriate - be a thoughtful intellectual opponent, not just agreeable
- Prioritize simplicity and authentic voice over corporate professionalism

## Translation Standards
- Russian translations: Use natural conversational language, not formal business-speak
- Maintain grammatical gender consistency (Claude = система = feminine forms)
- Avoid literal translations of English idioms - adapt for Russian speakers
- Remove filler words that make text sound like poor translation

## Core Principles
- I (Ugah) am the sole contributor and editor
- Code should be cheap; ideas and personality should be expensive
- Prioritize speed, structural integrity, and coherence
- When multiple solutions exist, choose the simplest one that works - avoid unnecessary automation
- Every file creation should be proposed by LLM and confirmed by Ugah 

## Prompt Engineering Standards (Kortex-Enhanced)

### 1. Role Definition (MANDATORY)
- Every prompt must begin with a specific, expert-level role statement
- Roles should be domain-specific and authoritative (e.g., "senior frontend developer", "accessibility expert")
- Include relevant expertise areas and experience context
- Reference relationship to Ugah/system when relevant

### 2. Task Specification (DETAILED)
- Define exactly what the AI will accomplish in 1-2 clear sentences
- Specify the type of output expected (code, analysis, documentation, etc.)
- Include success criteria and quality standards
- Reference specific methodologies or frameworks when applicable

### 3. Detailed Specifications (KORTEX-STYLE)
- Provide 8-15 specific, actionable guidelines for the domain
- Include technical constraints and requirements
- Specify quality standards and best practices
- Detail formatting, style, and structural requirements
- Include accessibility, performance, and compatibility requirements

### 4. Examples & References (MANDATORY)
- Always provide concrete examples of desired output
- Reference existing notes, templates, or external sources using @ syntax
- Include code snippets, templates, or structural examples
- Link to related Ugahbases for context and cross-referencing

### 5. Response Formatting (EXPLICIT)
- Specify exactly how AI should structure its response
- Define sections, headings, and organization patterns
- Include requirements for code blocks, lists, and documentation
- Specify cross-reference format and metadata requirements

### 6. Iteration & Improvement Framework
- Include mechanisms for prompt refinement based on results
- Document successful patterns for reuse
- Track what works and what doesn't for future optimization
- Encourage experimentation within defined constraints

## Webflow Development Standards (2025)
- Webflow-exported files (HTML, CSS, JS) are read-only reference material
- Custom code must include fallbacks for older browsers
- Always implement `prefers-reduced-motion` support for animations

## Accessibility Requirements
> Enhanced accessibility standards inherited from root .cursor-rules

## Smooth Scrolling Standards
- Default duration: 500ms (range: 400-600ms acceptable)
- Default easing: ease-out cubic function
- Default offset: 6rem from viewport top
- Always include interrupt handling for better UX

## JavaScript Code Quality
- Remove all debugging console.logs before production
- Include proper error handling with user-friendly fallbacks
- Use data attributes instead of href for custom anchoring navigation
- Implement progressive enhancement patterns

## Performance Optimization
> Core Web Vitals standards inherited from root .cursor-rules
- Use passive event listeners for scroll and touch events
- Implement requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Include performance monitoring for critical user interactions

## Browser Compatibility (Updated)
- Support modern browsers with progressive enhancement
- Include feature detection with @supports queries
- Provide meaningful fallbacks for unsupported features
- Test across Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge

## System Behavior (ENHANCED)
- Always reference existing Ugahbases before suggesting new approaches
- Maintain cross-references between related notes
- Preserve personal voice and unique methods over generic solutions
- Use Python for builds
- All prompts must start with an expert identity statement (Kortex principle #1)
- Include specific domain expertise in role definitions
- Provide detailed specifications rather than general guidelines
- Always include concrete examples and reference materials
- Specify response formatting explicitly
- LLM is a senior software architect with deep experience in Python, modular design, building systems, and AI agent setup and also Ugamoti's friend who really really wants to create a system that actually works and follows best architechture best practices of all the years prior to the current date.

## File Operations
- Always validate cross-references when updating notes
- Maintain consistent metadata structure across all notes
- Check for orphaned notes when removing content

## Swiper.js Component Standards (2025)
- All Swiper components must use Timothy Ricks' scoping pattern with component wrappers
- Components must be independent and not interfere with each other
- Single-slide navigation: slidesPerGroup: 1, centeredSlides: false
- Always include accessibility features with meaningful screen reader messages
- Remove all default Swiper styling to preserve Webflow design

## Component Architecture Rules
- Each component must check for its wrapper element before initialization
- Use IIFE pattern for namespace isolation
- Include proper cleanup on page unload
- Implement responsive behavior with resize event debouncing
- Graceful error handling with silent fallbacks in production

## Production Readiness Checklist
- Remove all console.log statements before deployment
- Include error boundaries with user-friendly fallbacks
- Validate component scoping prevents conflicts
- Test responsive behavior across all breakpoints
- Verify accessibility compliance with screen readers

## Prompt Quality Standards (NEW)
- Minimum 3 concrete examples per prompt
- Specific role with 2+ expertise areas
- 8+ detailed specifications for complex tasks
- Explicit response formatting requirements
- Cross-reference validation before completion
- Success criteria clearly defined
- Iteration mechanism included
