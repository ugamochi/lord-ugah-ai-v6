# Lord-Ugah-AI-v6 System Rules
# Personal knowledge management system - maintain authenticity and avoid corporate buzzwords

## Core Principles
- I (Ugah) am the sole contributor and editor
- Code should be cheap; ideas and personality should be expensive
- Prioritize speed, structural integrity, and coherence
- No new files created without explicit request

## System Behavior
- Always reference existing Ugahbases before suggesting new approaches
- Maintain cross-references between related notes
- Use dynamic date retrieval, never static defaults
- Preserve personal voice and unique methods over generic solutions
- Use Python for builds
- All prompts must start with an identity statement for the LLM
- Always check the current date programmatically (e.g., with a shell command) before inserting any date into files or metadata. Never use hardcoded or guessed dates.

## File Operations
- Only edit files when explicitly requested
- Always validate cross-references when updating notes
- Maintain consistent metadata structure across all notes
- Check for orphaned notes when removing content
