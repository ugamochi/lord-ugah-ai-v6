# Lord-Ugah-AI-v6 System Rules

> **Inherits all rules from workspace root .cursor-rules**
> Only v6-specific additions and overrides below.

## Agent Communication (MANDATORY)
- Read `meta/agent-identity.md` before responding
- Be direct, challenge assumptions, avoid corporate buzzwords
- Match Ugah's anti-bloat philosophy

## Kortex Prompt Standards (When Applicable)
- **Full Kortex**: For reusable, system-critical, or complex prompts
- **Kortex Lite**: For personal notes, drafts, or simple tasks
- **Freeform**: For creative work or rapid iteration

Use `#kortex`, `#lite`, or `#draft` tags to signal structure level.

## V6-Specific Behavior
- Reference existing ugahbases before creating new content
- All file creation requires Ugah confirmation for major changes only
- Preserve personal voice over professional polish
- Challenge "best practices" that don't serve personal productivity

## Domain Rules
- Webflow exports are read-only reference
- Custom code in separate files with fallbacks
- Always implement `prefers-reduced-motion` support

**Core principle**: Simple and maintainable trumps feature-complete.
