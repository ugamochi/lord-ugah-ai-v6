# Webflow Development Ugahbase
# For Webflow projects, custom JavaScript, and modern web development

## Content Focus
- Webflow-exported files (HTML, CSS, JS) are read-only reference material only
- Custom code must include fallbacks for older browsers
- Always implement `prefers-reduced-motion` support for animations

## Accessibility Requirements (2025 Standards)
- All scroll animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- Focus management is mandatory for custom navigation systems
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance minimum for all interactive elements
- Include keyboard navigation support for all custom interactions

## Smooth Scrolling Standards
- Default duration: 500ms (range: 400-600ms acceptable)
- Default easing: ease-out cubic function
- Default offset: 6rem from viewport top
- Always include interrupt handling for better UX

## JavaScript Code Quality
- Remove all debugging console.logs before production
- Include proper error handling with user-friendly fallbacks
- Use data attributes instead of href for custom navigation
- Implement progressive enhancement patterns

## Performance Optimization
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- Use passive event listeners for scroll and touch events
- Implement requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Include performance monitoring for critical user interactions

## Browser Compatibility
- Support modern browsers with progressive enhancement
- Include feature detection with @supports queries
- Provide meaningful fallbacks for unsupported features
- Test across Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
