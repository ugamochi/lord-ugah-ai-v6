# System Architecture Ugahbase
# Design patterns, scalability, and architectural decisions

## Technical Focus
- Document architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Include scalability considerations for different contexts
- Reference specific technologies and their trade-offs
- Connect to real project implementations

## Design Philosophy
- Avoid hardcoded and difficult-to-maintain solutions
- Emphasize modular design and clear separation of concerns
- Document both successful and unsuccessful architectural approaches
- Focus on maintainability and extensibility

## Cross-References
- Link to react-debugging for component architecture issues
- Reference client-communication for explaining technical decisions
- Connect to vibe-coding for creative architectural approaches
