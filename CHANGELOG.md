# Lord-Ugah-AI-v6 Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
- **Added `meta/agent-identity.md`**: Captured optimal AI communication style and tone preferences for consistent future interactions  
- **Added `meta/daily-launch-prompt.md`**: Copy-paste prompt to instantly load v6 context into fresh AI conversations
- **Removed `scripts/initialize.py`**: Redundant directory creation script - create directories manually when needed
- Major system simplification and bloat removal (2025-06-26)
- **Phase 1**: Deleted enterprise bloat (4 unnecessary scripts, verbose docs)
- **Phase 2**: Simplified remaining scripts (removed dual import complexity), standardized .cursor-rules templates, created simple workflow checklists
- Consolidated documentation: README + ONBOARDING → single guide, verbose analysis → quick reference
- Environment variables: 12+ → 2 essential settings
- **Result**: Lean, functional system focused on creativity over administration
- Added 'modified_date' field to YAML frontmatter of all Ugahbase notes for metadata compliance (2025-06-15)
- Added __init__.py to scripts/ directory to resolve Python import path issues

### Bloat Cleanup Applied (2025-07-01)
**Used Simple Bloat Detector to clean system:**
- **Archived unused ugahbases**: `books/` (rarely used) → `archive/unused-2025-07-01/`
- **Merged audit tools**: Combined `system-audit-simple.md` + `bloat-detector-simple.md` → `system-maintenance.md`
- **Cleaned backup explosion**: Removed 100+ redundant backup files across v3/v4 systems
- **Streamlined scripts**: Prefer manual checklist over Python for infrequent tasks

### Consolidated (2025-07-01)
- **Merged redundant prompts**: Combined `daily-launch-prompt.md` and `rule-enforcer-wrapper.md` into single `daily-launch-prompt.md` with built-in enforcement
- **Archived duplicates**: Moved original files to `archive/unused-2025-07-01/`
- **Enhanced enforcement**: Daily launch now includes mandatory rule verification for each response

### Simplified (2025-07-01)
- **Created simplified versions** of complex meta-prompts:
  - `meta/system-audit-simple.md` - 3-section audit vs. 10-section original
  - `meta/bloat-detector-simple.md` - One-page checklist vs. verbose analysis framework
- **Streamlined `.cursor-rules`** - Removed redundant sections, kept only v6-specific overrides
- **Added lightweight alternatives** for scripts:
  - `scripts/manual-ugahbase-creation.md` - Manual checklist for infrequent use
  - `scripts/simple-link-check.sh` - Basic shell script for quick link checking
- **Condensed README.md** - Focused on essential daily-use information
- **Created `templates/simple-prompt-template.md`** - Lighter alternative to full Kortex structure
- All original files preserved in backup: `ugah-ai-backups/simplification-backup-2025-07-01.tar.gz`

### Added
- Initial system scaffold, core Ugahbases, templates, and scripts
- Meta-system automation (meta_updater.py)
- Performance monitoring (performance_monitor.py)
- Onboarding and integration workflow (ONBOARDING.md)

### Changed
- Refactored scripts for robust path handling and dynamic date insertion

### Fixed
- Ensured all example notes use current date, not hardcoded values

## 2025-06-26 — v6 Optimization & Consolidation

- Merged component-architecture-patterns.md into component-architecture-validator.md (core best practices and validation now unified)
- Merged swiper-accessibility-checklist.md and swiper-navigation-cleaner.md into webflow-swiper-component-generator.md (all accessibility and navigation cleaning best practices now unified)
- Archived original patterns, checklist, and navigation cleaner files in archive/deep/
- Moved large/superseded files (v6-build.md, v6-enhance-1.md) to archive/deep/
- Added cross-reference notes to all .cursor-rules files in v6, clarifying inheritance from the root .cursor-rules
- No destructive changes; all actions are reversible and fully documented
