# Scripts Configuration
# Automation and maintenance tools for Lord-Ugah-AI-v6 expansion

## Script Behavior
- All scripts should be self-documenting and expansion-aware
- Include error handling and user feedback for scaling operations
- Maintain system integrity checks across unlimited Ugahbases
- Log operations for debugging and growth pattern analysis

## Expansion-Focused Scripts
- ugahbase_creator.py: Generate new Ugahbases from templates
- expansion_helper.py: Suggest connections and optimizations
- cross_reference_mapper.py: Discover and validate inter-Ugahbase links
- performance_monitor.py: Track system performance as it scales

## Development Guidelines
- Keep scripts modular and reusable across domains
- Design for handling 500+ Ugahbases efficiently
- Include type hints and docstrings for maintainability
- Test scripts with large-scale scenarios
